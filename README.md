 ## The Problem

 ### What?

NUS Engineering is a labyrinth to navigate. Ever tried finding LT1? I have. It took me and a friend half an hour of walking (running), including under the hot August afternoon sun, only to still be 10 minutes late. The signs don't help matters; try following the signs from, say, E4 to EA. Even after a year of studying there, I still get lost at NUS FoE. It's a massive faculty spread over so many different buildings that it's inevitably really hard to navigate. Plus, whenever I ask the class Whatsapp group how to get somewhere, the answer is "just use google maps lol" which is not very helpful because Google Maps can't exactly take me from E3-06-05 to EA-06-23 or something. - Neil

 ### Who?

* NUS Engineering students like ourselves who constantly get lost in the labyrinth that is the Faculty of Engineering

* Visitors to NUS Engineering, such as prospective students during open days/information sessions, guest speakers etc.

* Staff, professors, lecturers, and other faculty members who may also get lost at times. 

 ### Why?

No one likes being late to class, whether as a student or a teacher. Sometimes, you just get lost and waste time just wandering around in the completely wrong place. Other times, you underestimate just how long the walk to LT7 is from E5, and leave for a 17:00 lecture at 16:55. If you have an exam or test you cannot be late for, being able to find the classroom/location on time becomes even more important. 


 ## Our Solution

 ### What?

* Web app similar to Google Maps, but specifically for the NUS Faculty of Engineering. 

* Enter a start and end point and get turn-by-turn directions to where you want to go, with the shortest route.

* Find wheelchair-friendly routes if you can't, or don't want to, use the stairs for whatever reason. 

* **Possible extension**: Find nearby toilets/food outlets/staircases/other facilities

* **Possible extension**: Progresssive Web App which can be installed on any device with a supported web browser. No proprietary app stores needed! (plus we save on the developer account fees)

 ### How?

* Front end web client coded with React

* Back end server coded with Node.js + Express

* Database powered by MySQL

 ### When?
